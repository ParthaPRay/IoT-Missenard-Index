Thermal comfort is an important factor in human body. It can seriously impact on the livelihood factors of human such as lifestyle, productivity, societal activity, and health of an individual. It holds tremendous adverse affect toward diminishing of tolerance to other environmental hazards too. In this paper, an Internet of Things based cloud enabled measurement of MISSENARD index is proposed. A prototype system is implemented based on the proposed novel architecture for measuring thermal comfort of the indoor occupants. The system is developed to apprehend the Internet of Things based multiple cloud services as an important enabler for conferring to MISSENARD index monitoring in real time. The developed system holds a novel way of smarter integration of sensor fueled data analytics with cloud supported visualization at the same time. It further validates the usability of several plug-ins, different Application Programming Interfaces (API), heterogeneous network communications, and low power, memory constrained yet cost effective processor altogether to testify the underlying theory of Internet of Things to become prevalent into a reality.
